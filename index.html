                        I am currently working on unsupervised deep learning research for computer vision. Details TBD.

                        Fall 2018, I worked part-time at <a href="https://remeeting.com/" target="_blank">Remeeting</a>, a startup in Berkeley that develops state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR) technology. I studied acoustic feature extraction and acoustic modeling for speech recognition, trained a few HMM-GMM/DNN acoustic models on large datasets using Kaldi, and also built a GMM-based language-ID tool.
                    </h2>
                    <h2>
                        The summer of 2018, I interned full-time at Remeeting, where I co-developed a WebRTC-based video conferencing product from scratch that integrates Remeetingâ€™s ASR. The application allows Remeeting to showcase their ASR and new search technology with high quality recordings.

                    <h2>
                        In fall 2017, I was a Technical Project Manager at <a href="https://codebase.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Codebase@Berkeley</a>, a student-run organization that provides SWE services to high-growth startups.
                        I led an 8 person team on a semester-long full-stack development project, where we delivered prototype AWS backend for a local Berkeley startup.

                    <h2>
                        The previous semester, I was a Project Developer at Codebase, and I helped my team develop an API using Node.js and MongoDB that integrated data from various IoT devices with our clients' database.

                    <h2>
                        As a junior in high school, I was fortunate enough to get my feet wet in full stack development at EzPzDay, a small startup from San Francisco. I worked on developing their first client-facing website.
