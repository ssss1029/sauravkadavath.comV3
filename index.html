                        I am currently working in Prof. Dawn Song’s lab at UC Berkeley on deep learning research. I'm focusing on improving neural network performance under difficult conditions; e.g. adversarial examples, corrupted data, data with unwanted spurious correlations, etc.

                    <h2>
                        Summer 2019, worked as a software engineering intern at <a href="https://www.okta.com/" target="_blank">Okta</a> in SF. I was on the Core Infrastructure Reliability Team, where I worked on a new, scalable application monitoring system that solved problems that external monitoring solutions could not.

                    <h2>
                        The Summer and Fall of 2018, I worked at <a href="https://remeeting.com/" target="_blank">Remeeting</a>, a startup in Berkeley that develops state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR) technology. I mainly worked on a WebRTC-based video conferencing product from scratch that integrates Remeeting’s ASR. I also learned a lot about speech recognition, trained a few HMM-GMM/DNN acoustic models on large datasets using Kaldi, and built a GMM-based language-ID tool.

                    <h2>
                        In Spring and Fall 2017, I was involved with <a href="https://codebase.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Codebase@Berkeley</a>, a student-run organization that provides SWE services to high-growth startups.
                        I led an 8 person team on a semester-long full-stack development project, where we delivered prototype AWS backend for a local Berkeley startup.

                        The previous semester, I was a Project Developer at Codebase, and I helped my team develop an API using Node.js and MongoDB that integrated data from various IoT devices with our clients' database.

                        As a junior in high school, I was fortunate enough to get my feet wet in full stack development at EzPzDay, a small startup from San Francisco. I worked on developing their first client-facing website.
