                        The summer of 2018, I interned at <a href="https://remeeting.com/">Remeeting</a>, where I co-developed a WebRTC-based video conferencing product that integrates Remeetingâ€™s
                        state-of-the-art <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_recognition">ASR</a> technology. The application allows Remeeting to showcase their technology with high quality recordings.

                        In fall 2017, I was a Technical Project Manager at <a href="https://codebase.berkeley.edu/">Codebase@Berkeley</a>, a student-run organization that provides SWE services to high-growth startups.
                        I led an 8 person team on a semester-long full-stack development project, where we delivered prototype AWS backend for a local Berkeley startup.

                        The previous semester, I was a Project Developer at <a href="https://codebase.berkeley.edu/">Codebase</a>, and I helped my team develop an API using Node.js and MongoDB that integrated data from various IoT devices with our clients' database.

                        As a junior in high school, I was fortunate enough to get my feet wet in full stack development at EzPzDay, a small startup from San Francisco. I worked on developing their first client-facing website.
